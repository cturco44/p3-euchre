Card Functions:
    Connor:
        a.	Card()
        b.	Card (…)
        c.	get_rank()
        d.	get_suit()
        e.	get_suit(…)
        f.	is_face()
        g.	is_right_bower()
        h.	is_left_bower()
        i.	is_trump()
    Matt:
        j.	operator<()
        k.	operator==()
        l.	operator!=()
        m.	suit_next()
        n.	operator<<
        o.	Card_less()
        p.	Card_less(…)

Player:

So far, I've created two instances of player, Human and Simple. I added the
private variable name and a constructor for both of them. I also completed
the << overload and the Player_factory function. All we need to do is finish
coding the derived classes HumanPlayer and SimplePlayer as well as write test
cases.

I figured a simple way to divide this up would be to I code simple and you do
human, but if you want to do it another way I'm cool with that to.
